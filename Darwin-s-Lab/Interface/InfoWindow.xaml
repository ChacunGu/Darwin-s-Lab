            A complete cycle is represented by a full day. At dawn food grows in the danger zone (inner circle). Creatures will then wakeup and start hunting. They will walk randomly in the zone until they can see a piece of food. The bigger their detection range the further they are able to detect food. They will then rush to their precious target, eat it and regain energy. The fed creature will then have to choose: stay a bit longer to search for more food or get safely back home. Their choice is influenced by the time of the day. The longer the creature hunt the higher the chance to get back home. At twilight the creatures still hunting will have to rush in the safe zone. If they do not make it back until midnight they die. Each creature has a certain amount of energy. They spend it for hunting and gain some when eating. A creature with no energy can't move and if still in the danger zone will then die at the end of the day. After midnight comes the time of mutations. Each creature has a low chance to mutate one or several of its genes. If it does the creature will blink. Finally each creature with enough energy will select a mate in its range and walk towards them. They will then mate and give birth to a newborn with a mix of its parents genes. Each creature sleeps for the remaining time of the night regaining lots of energy for the next day to come.
